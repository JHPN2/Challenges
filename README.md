# Theater Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

Help the client, Louisa, crowdsource her play by analyzing Kickstarter data of past theater campaigns.

### Purpose

Using data from past Kickstarter campaigns, we are to determine the what amount of crowdfunding is needed and when is the optimal time to begin the campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

Raw Kickstarter data was obtained regarding a multitude of different crowdfunding campaigns encompassing a span of a few years. Our primary interest were focused on the Theater category, specifically the Plays sub-category. We wanted to know what the data showed for Plays that were successful and Plays that failed to reach their goal. The challenge was sorting through all the data, parsing what was relavant, and analyzing the portion we wanted. The results gave us a clear picture as to what factors lead to a successful Plays Kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One of the factors that leads to a successful campaign is timing the launch date. Based on the data, it was determined that a start date from April to August where more likely to reach the crowdfunding goal. In Louisa's case, we would recommend a start date between those months mentioned to achieve success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Another factor to consider is the crowdfunding goal amount. Based on the data, it shows that an amount ranging from $15,000 and below gave a successful results. Looking at the range closer, we can determine that the lower the goal amount from $15,000 the better the chance of successfully crowdfunding the campaign. The data also shows a successful range of between $35,000 to $44,999. Although the data shows a favorable chance of succeeding in this higher range, we would not recommend setting a goal this high without futher analysis in this range. Therefore, we would recommend Louisa consider a goal range of between $1,000 to $10,000 for a successful campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Part of the challenges and difficulties where sorting through all the Kickstarter data. In the raw data 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
